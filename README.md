# RmxMovies

RmxMovies is an app to manage your favourite movies.


## NX

This workspace is managed with [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)

## Development server

Run `nx serve` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Styles

This project uses [Sass](https://sass-lang.com), [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) to manage CSS styling.
This project uses [PrimeNG](https://sass-lang.com) components as "design system".

## Tests

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io), [spectator](https://github.com/ngneat/spectator), and [ng-mocks](https://ng-mocks.sudo.eu) for unit and integration tests.

Run them with: `nx test --watch`

This project uses [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io) for e2e tests.

With the app running on localhost, run them with: `nx run e2e:e2e --watch` and choose a different port for Cypress.

If you are new to Cypress, check out this [brief guide](https://medium.com/@aleixsuau/cypress-the-crash-post-a0c9c2dd3574)

## Project Architecture

### About monorepos

A monorepo is a single repository containing multiple distinct projects, with well-defined relationships. [Read more](https://monorepo.tools)

### About NX

This app uses NX as a build system and follows its guidelines for monorepo workspaces. It also follows the Domain Driving Design (DDD) principles to structure and name the code reflecting the business domain.

A NX workspace is structured into `apps` and `libs`.

#### App

An `app` is a deployable container that links, bundles, and compiles some `libs` together. For example, this `app` aggregates all the `libs` (`subdomains`) needed to provide the functionality of the tool.

#### Libs

A `lib` is a container that groups related functionality/code (`subdomain`).

##### Folder structure

Inside the `libs` folder, the libraries are structured per `scope` (`subdomain`) in the first level, and per `type` in the following levels.

There are 4 `types` of libraries:

* Feature: implements smart UI (with access to data sources) for specific business use cases or pages in an application.
* UI: contains only presentational components (also called "dumb" components).
* Data-access: contains code for interacting with a back-end system. It also includes all the code related to state management.
* Util: contains low-level utilities used by many libraries and applications.

[Read more](https://nx.dev/structure/library-types)

The naming convention for libraries follows its folder path, this is `scope-type-functionality`. So for example, a `lib` placed in `libs/course/feature/certification` is named `course-feature-certification`. This favors a meaningful encapsulation of the code (resembling the real world wording), making it more predictable, understandable, and findable.

All the libs used by multiple `scopes` are placed in the `shared` folder, also organized per `type` (e.g. `shared-data-access-rest-api`).

Tips:

* Use the NX Console VSCode plugin to create your `libs`.

#### Tags & Dependency rules

In order to maintain our code as decoupled as possible, NX provides a way of defining and enforcing dependency boundaries based on `tags` and `dependency rules`.

* Tags: are used to define the `app`, `type` and `scope` (`subdomain`) of the `lib`. For example, `{"course-feature-certification": { "tags": ["app:workshop", "scope:course", "type:feature"] }}`. This is done in the [NX config file](./nx.json).
* Dependency rules: are used to limit the `tags` that a `lib` can depend on. For example, `{ "sourceTag": "scope:course", "onlyDependOnLibsWithTags": ["scope:course", "scope:shared"] }`. This is done in the global [.eslintrc.json file](./.eslintrc.json).

4 dependency rules:

* `app` and `feature` libs can depend on `feature`, `data-access`, `ui` or `util` libs, but not on `app`. Just keep in mind to move to `shared` those `libs` that are used by multiple `scopes`.
* `ui` libs can only depend on other `ui` or `util` libs.
* `data-access` libs can depend on `data-access` and `util` libs.
* `util` libs can depend only on other `util` libs.

Always tag and define dependency rules for the new `libs`.

#### Tips

* Use the [NX Console VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console) to create and tag your `libs`.
* Use the NX Project Graph to visualize the dependency relationships in your code. For example, in the terminal you would run `nx affected:dep-graph --files=libs/[path-to-file].component.ts` to see the graph of the `libs` that would be affected by a change on that component (because they depend on it).
* Use `nx affected:test` to test all the files affected by a change. For example, in the terminal you would run `nx affected:test --files=libs/[path-to-file].component.ts` to test the files affected by a change on that component.
* Move `libs` around with `nx g @nrwl/workspace:move --project [projectName] [destinationPath]`. It will take care of moving and renaming all the files.
* Check out what the [NX CLI can do for you](https://nx.dev/using-nx/nx-cli).
